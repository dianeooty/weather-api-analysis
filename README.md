# python-api-challenge
> This my Module 6 challenge for my Data Analytics and Visualization Boot Camp.  I was tasked with using Python requests,
API, and Json to analyze what the weather is like as we approach the equator and finding the hotels within my ideal 
temperatures for vacations.

## General Information
- FOr the WeatherPy analysis, I am using the latitudes for a list of cities to analyze the temperature, humidity, 
cloudiness and wind speed. After parsing the data from the API request, I created dataframes for plotting scatter plots and regression for analysis.

- For the VacationPy analyis, I am using the latitudes and longitudes for a list of cities to display hvplots of city and hotel locations on a map. 


## Technologies Used
- Python
- API
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Hvplot
