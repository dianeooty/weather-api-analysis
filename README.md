# ather-api-analysis
> Using the weather and vacation datasets, I was tasked with using Python requests, API, and Json to analyze what the weather is like as we approach the equator and finding the hotels within my ideal weather conditions for vacation.

## General Information
- For the WeatherPy analysis, I am using the longitudes and latitudes of a random list of cities within a specific range to analyze the temperature, humidity, 
cloudiness and wind speed. After parsing the data from the API request, I created dataframes for plotting scatter plots and regression for analysis.

- For the VacationPy analysis, I am using the latitudes and longitudes of a list of cities from a csv to display hvplots of cities and hotel locations on maps. 


## Technologies Used
- Python
- API
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Hvplot

## Setup
The cities data can be found in output_data folder. The APIs used for this challenge are Geoapify and OpenWeatherMap.


## Project Status
Project is complete and no longer being worked on.
